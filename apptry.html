    <h3>Structured programming</h3>
  </div><hr>
  <div class="card-body">
    
    <p class="card-text"> Structured programming is a logical programming method that is considered a precursor to object-oriented programming (OOP). Structured programming facilitates program understanding and modification and has a top-down design approach, where a system is divided into compositional subsystems.
    	Examples of Structured Programming language are C, C+, C++, C#, Java, PERL, Ruby, PHP, ALGOL, Pascal, PL/I and Ada; and example of unstructured Programming language are BASIC (early version), JOSS, FOCAL, MUMPS, TELCOMP, COBOL.

   Imperative Programming
 </h3> </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    
    <p class="card-text">In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. </p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>To make programs simpler for a human to read and write, imperative statements can be grouped into sections known as code blocks. In the 1950s, the idea of grouping a program's code into blocks was first implemented in the ALGOL programming language. They were originally called "compound statements," but today these blocks of code are known as procedures. Once a procedure is defined, it can be used as a single imperative statement, abstracting the control flow of a program and allowing the developer to express programming ideas more naturally. This type of imperative programming is called procedural programming, and it is a step towards higher-level abstractions such as declarative programming.<p>

   <h3> Functional Programming</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    
    <p class="card-text">Functional programming has become a really hot topic in the JavaScript world. Just a few years ago, few JavaScript programmers even knew what functional programming is, but every large application codebase I’ve seen in the past 3 years makes heavy use of functional programming ideas.
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.</p>
<p>Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles (listed above). Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Procedural Programming may be the first programming paradigm that a new developer will learn. Fundamentally, the procedural code is the one that directly instructs a device on how to finish a task in logical steps. This paradigm uses a linear top-down approach and treats data and procedures as two different entities. Based on the concept of a procedure call, Procedural Programming divides the program into procedures, which are also known as routines or functions, simply containing a series of steps to be carried out.

Simply put, Procedural Programming involves writing down a list of instructions to tell the computer what it should do step-by-step to finish the task at hand.<p>

    <p class="card-text">It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism.
In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem.

  Functional programming paradigms </h3>

The functional programming paradigms has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure. Data are loosely coupled to functions.The function hide their implementation. Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program. Some of the languages like perl, javascript mostly uses this paradigm.</p>

   <h3>Parallel Programming</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
   
    <p class="card-text">It is the use of multiple processing elements simultaneously for solving any problem. Problems are broken down into instructions and are solved concurrently as each resource which has been applied to work is working at the same time.</p>
<p>
<strong>Advantages of Parallel Computing over Serial Computing are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It saves time and money as many resources working together will reduce the time and cut potential costs.</li>
<li>It can be impractical to solve larger problems on Serial Computing.</li>
<li>It can take advantage of non-local resources when the local resources are finite.</li>
<li>Serial Computing ‘wastes’ the potential computing power, thus Parallel Computing makes better work of hardware.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Types of Parallelism:</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Bit-level parallelism: </strong>It is the form of parallel computing which is based on the increasing processor’s size. It reduces the number of instructions that the system must execute in order to perform a task on large-sized data.
Example: Consider a scenario where an 8-bit processor must compute the sum of two 16-bit integers. It must first sum up the 8 lower-order bits, then add the 8 higher-order bits, thus requiring two instructions to perform the operation. A 16-bit processor can perform the operation with just one instruction.</p><p>
<strong>Instruction-level parallelism:</strong> A processor can only address less than one instruction for each clock cycle phase. These instructions can be re-ordered and grouped which are later on executed concurrently without affecting the result of the program. This is called instruction-level parallelism.
Task Parallelism: Task parallelism employs the decomposition of a task into subtasks and then allocating each of the subtasks for execution. The processors perform execution of sub tasks concurrently.</p>

   <h3>Concurrent Programming</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    
    <p class="card-text">Concurrency generally refers to events or circumstances that are happening or existing at the same time.

In programming terms, concurrent programming is a technique in which two or more processes start, run in an interleaved fashion through context switching and complete in an overlapping time period by managing access to shared resources e.g. on a single core of CPU.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that multiple processes will be running at the same instant – even if the results might make it seem like it.</p>

    <h3>Dependent Type</h3>
    <p class="card-text">In computer science and logic, a dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value. It is an overlapping feature of type theory and type systems. In intuitionistic type theory, dependent types are used to encode logic's quantifiers like "for all" and "there exists". In functional programming languages like Agda, ATS, Coq, F*, Epigram, and Idris, dependent types may help reduce bugs by enabling the programmer to assign types that further restrain the set of possible implementations.

Two common examples of dependent types are dependent functions and dependent pairs. The return type of a dependent function may depend on the value (not just type) of one of its arguments. For instance, a function that takes a positive integer {\displaystyle n} n may return an array of length {\displaystyle n} n, where the array length is part of the type of the array. (Note that this is different from polymorphism and generic programming, both of which include the type as an argument.) A dependent pair may have a second value of which the type depends on the first value. Sticking with the array example, a dependent pair may be used to pair an array with its length in a type-safe way.

Dependent types add complexity to a type system. Deciding the equality of dependent types in a program may require computations. If arbitrary values are allowed in dependent types, then deciding type equality may involve deciding whether two arbitrary programs produce the same result; hence type checking may become undecidable..</p>

       <h4>ABOUT</h4>
        <p class="card-text">The graphical user interface (GUI /ˈdʒiːjuːaɪ/ gee-you-eye[1][Note 1] or /ˈɡuːi/[2]) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs),[3][4][5] which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.

The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.[6][7][8] Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls. The term GUI tends not to be applied to other lower-display resolution types of interfaces, such as video games (where head-up display (HUD)[9] is preferred), or not including flat screens, like volumetric displays[10] because the term is restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens able to describe generic information, in the tradition of the computer science research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.</p>

        <p class="card-text"><H3>USER INTERFACE AND INTERACTION DESIGN</H3>
Designing the visual composition and temporal behavior of a GUI is an important part of software application programming in the area of human–computer interaction. Its goal is to enhance the efficiency and ease of use for the underlying logical design of a stored program, a design discipline named usability. Methods of user-centered design are used to ensure that the visual language introduced in the design is well-tailored to the tasks.

The visible graphical interface features of an application are sometimes referred to as chrome or GUI (pronounced gooey).[11][12] Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual widgets that allow for interactions appropriate to the kind of data they hold. The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A model–view–controller allows flexible structures in which the interface is independent from and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different skin at will, and eases the designer's work to change the interface as user needs evolve. Good user interface design relates to users more, and to system architecture less. Large widgets, such as windows, usually provide a frame or container for the main presentation content such as a web page, email message or drawing. Smaller ones usually act as a user-input tool.</p>

    <h3>Automata Based Approach</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <div class="card-title">
    <p class="card-text">Automata-based programming is a programming paradigm in which the program or part of it is thought of as a model of a finite-state machine (FSM) or any other (often more complicated) formal automaton (see automata theory). Sometimes a potentially infinite set of possible states is introduced, and such a set can have a complicated structure, not just an enumeration.

Finite-state machine-based programming is generally the same, but, formally speaking, does not cover all possible variants, as FSM stands for finite-state machine, and automata-based programming does not necessarily employ FSMs in the strict sense.

The following properties are key indicators for automata-based programming:
<ul>
  <li>The time period of the program's execution is clearly separated down to the automaton steps. Each step is effectively an execution of a code section (same for all the steps) which has a single entry point. That section might be divided down to subsections to be executed depending on different states, although this is not necessary.</li>

<li>Any communication between the automaton steps is only possible via the explicitly noted set of variables named the automaton state. Between any two steps, the program cannot have implicit components of its state, such as local variables' values, return addresses, the current instruction pointer, etc. That is, the state of the whole program, taken at any two moments of entering an automaton step, can only differ in the values of the variables being considered as the automaton state</li>

  <h3>SYMBOLIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH</h3>  
  <p>In computer programming, symbolic programming is a programming paradigm in which the program can manipulate its own formulas and program components as if they were plain data.

Through symbolic programming, complex processes can be developed that build other more intricate processes by combining smaller units of logic or functionality. Thus, such programs can effectively modify themselves and appear to "learn", which makes them better suited for applications such as artificial intelligence, expert systems, natural language processing, and computer games.

anguages that support symbolic programming include homoiconic languages such as Wolfram Language, LISP and Prolog.</p>
